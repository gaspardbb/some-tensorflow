# Hands on Tensorflow 2.0

This repository simply gathers some pieces of code I did to get used to the new tensorflow 2.0 API.
It contains:
* `encoder_decoder.py`: some functions and classes on encoder and decoder models and layers.
* `cycle_gan.py`: some utility functions to get a cycle gan running rapidly.
* `ellipses_to_cell_gan.py`: a try at generating cells-like mass cytometry samples, prior to usual supervised training.
* `chan_vese.py`: a tensorflow implementation of the Chan-Vese segmentation algorithm, to see if it could be faster than a standard python implementation.
